        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road networks. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have been conducted to estimate origin-destination (OD) demand based on vehicle trajectory data. However, the estimation accuracy heavily relies on the temporal-spatial distribution of trajectories, and its effect on OD estimation remains unrevealed and under-estimated. This study proposes a novel method for investigating the impact of the heterogeneity of trajectory data distribution on OD estimation at urban road networks. Synthetic scenarios are designed based on automatic license plate recognition data collected from a real-world traffic network in Kunshan, China. Four factors: test area, sampling rate, time period, and the sampling method are selected for scenario settings. Next, a particle filter-based method is implemented to reconstruct vehicle trajectories using the sampled trajectory data, and then the path flows and OD demands are extracted. Finally, a spatial statistics approach is introduced to reveal the spatial autocorrelation of trip generation/attraction variations, and the high-high clusters whose OD values are significantly affected are identified. Test results show that the heterogeneity effects of trajectory distribution on OD estimation can be effectively studied by the proposed method. Further investigation shows that the findings of spatial statistics can be applied for improving OD estimation accuracy.",
